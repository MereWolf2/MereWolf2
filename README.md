### Hi there 👋, I'm Mere

---

👩‍💻 I am a curious policy student at the London School of Economics, exploring data science. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about datascience by
  - studying Data Science for Social Scientists at LSE, and
  - taking a 'career course' on Dataquest, learning more about Excel, SQL, and Python
- 🤔 I’m looking for an internship or opportunity to practice my data science skills in the policy / charity sector!
